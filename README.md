# d3-force-directed-graph
FreeCodeCamp Project: Map Data Across the Globe using D3.js.

## Objectives:

- I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.

- I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.

- I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.

Built with D3.js v4
